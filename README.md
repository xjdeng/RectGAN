# RectGAN
The World's First Generative Adversarial Network that generates rectangular images.  Loosely based off of the [Keras-GAN-Animeface-Character](https://github.com/forcecore/Keras-GAN-Animeface-Character).

This is still a work in progress and many essential features are not supported and/or not adhering to best practices for GANs.  I'm no expert in GANs, but I've merely created RectGAN to make it easier to work with training and generating rectangular images, since the vast majority of image data that I have is in that format.
